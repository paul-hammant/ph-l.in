<h2>Paul Hammant's info &amp; links, in lieu of a business card</h2>
<p style="font-size: 80%">
    I am that widely-cited Trunk-Based Development and Monorepo expert, who co-created <a href="https://www.selenium.dev">Selenium</a> v1 in 2004,
    develops software generally for 31 years (including many new open-source tools), fills exec management roles,
    consults at and assesses corporates towards dialing up their software release cadence.<br/><br/>
    I recently co-founded a "new-bank" startup in Brazil, cutting the first code, staffing it up, and seeing it go-live
    and start to scale (with pivots) in a matter of months.
    As part of that, align all hires to a high-throughput way of working.<br/><br/>
    I also blog about architecture/design, agile, lean/TOC & flow, testing/testability, dependency injection, CI/CD,
    DevOps, team throughput,
    application strangulation, pseudo-declarative UI technologies, cookie-cutter scaling, merkle-trees, source-control
    generally, and more.<br/><br/>I'm ex of <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> (12 years). And via them, Google's <a target="_blank" href="https://mike-bland.com/2012/07/10/test-mercenaries.html">Test Mercenaries team</a>.<br/><br/>

<h3>Pandemic</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>I bought a sewing machine in Feb 2020, and made masks for donation to local non-profits. <a 
href="https://paulhammant.com/files/Spunbond_Polypropylene-suitability_for_high_filtration_masks.pdf">This mask is best performing one I made.</a> 
A 
year too late to have helped the pandemic during the shortage of N95s and alike. Thanks to an anonymous benefactor and a university in Thailand for 
the considerable testing effort.
