<h2>Paul Hammant's info &amp; links, in lieu of a business card</h2>
<p style="font-size: 80%">
    I am that widely-cited Trunk-Based Development and Monorepo expert, who co-created Selenium v1 in 2004,
    develops software generally for 31 years (including many new open-source tools), fills exec management roles,
    consults at and assesses corporates towards dialing up their software release cadence.<br/><br/>
    I recently co-founded a "new-bank" startup in Brazil, cutting the first code, staffing it up, and seeing it go-live
    and start to scale (with pivots) in a matter of months.
    As part of that, align all hires to a high-throughput way of working.<br/><br/>
    I also blog about architecture/design, agile, lean/TOC & flow, testing/testability, dependency injection, CI/CD,
    DevOps, team throughput,
    application strangulation, pseudo-declarative UI technologies, cookie-cutter scaling, merkle-trees, source-control
    generally, and more.<br/><br/>I'm ex of ThoughtWorks (12 years), and via them Google's <a href="https://mike-bland.com/2012/07/10/test-mercenaries.html">Test Mercenaries team</a>.<br/><br/>
